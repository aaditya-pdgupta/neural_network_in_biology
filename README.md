# Introduction

Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated network (SNNs) are sub-set of machine learning and are heart of deep learning algorithms. A standard neural network (NN) consists odf many simple, connected processors called neuron , each producing a sequence of real valued activations. An artificial neuron recieves a signals and then processes them and can signal neurons connected to it.

ANNs are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer. Each node or artificial neuron, connects to another has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the next layer of the network.
